## Today's goals

- Strange attractors, (1D vs 2D vs 3D)
- Ice (interlude)
- Drawing

## R Lorenz attractor

The behaviour of strange attractors is limited by the spacial dimension of the space it inhabits. In two dimensions: a continuous infinite curve cannot be chaotic, it has to end in a cycle or a fixed point. This is known as the PoincarÃ©-Bendixson theorem. 

1D - Only one direction. If space is bounded, fixed points.
2D - Only two directions. If space is bounded, cycles or fixed points.
3D - 3 directions. If space is bounded, you can still have chaotic orbits. You can also get cycles or fixed points.

Here is code for a Lorenz attractor plotter in r

```{r}

```
